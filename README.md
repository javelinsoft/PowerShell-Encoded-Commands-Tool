# PowerShell Encoded Commands Tool

The PowerShell Encoded Commands Tool is a web-based utility designed to simplify the encoding and decoding of PowerShell commands using the EncodedCommand technique. This technique involves converting PowerShell commands into a base64-encoded format, making them less susceptible to detection and modification.  

## Prerequisites:

- A Windows operating system with PowerShell installed.
- A text editor to create and save PowerShell scripts.
- A web browser to access the encoded command tool.

## Step 1: Create an Encoded PowerShell Command

1. Open the web-based tool using a web browser:

2. Enter a PowerShell command or script into the input textarea.
3. Click the "Encode" button to generate the encoded PowerShell command.
4. Copy the encoded command from the output textarea.

## Step 2: Open PowerShell

1. Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell" or "PowerShell" from the menu to open a PowerShell console.

## Step 3: Run the Encoded PowerShell Command

Let's say you have an encoded PowerShell command like this:


`powershell -encodedCommand <encoded_command_here>`

1. In the PowerShell console, paste the copied encoded command.
2. Press `Enter` to execute the encoded PowerShell command.

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute PowerShell commands on your system.
